The task is to study the suitability of different algorithms for spam email classification using the Ling-Spam dataset, which contains emails from four categories: lemn, bare, stop, lemn_stop. The spam emails have the prefix "spm" in the file name. The dataset should be understood and preprocessed before applying any algorithm. The chosen algorithm should be implemented and justified in a LaTeX report, both theoretically and experimentally, and compared with other candidate algorithms. The cross-validation strategy Leave-One-Out should be implemented and a graph should be attached to the report to illustrate the results. The performance of the algorithm on the test set should be also shown in a graph, and the accuracy should be better than any trivial strategy. Any other relevant details of the experiment should be explained in words or graphs. Possible improvements of the algorithm should be explored and implemented to increase the accuracy. As a bonus, a method for preprocessing unlabeled data should be implemented and described, and graphs for the error/accuracy at CVLOO and testing should be included in the report. The unlabeled data are the files from part1 and part2 of each category, regardless of the prefix "spm".
